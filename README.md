# DISCLAMIER

I have no idea how to program, let alone sometihng this complex I work in finance and this seemd like a good idea to pass my time. I only wrote a couple of lines of code to import the csv file, and Cursor wrote the rest. For some reason, it seems to work just fine, but the code is unreadable.


Input the CSV with your transactions from Degiro, and it calculates the Capital Gains for the sales you've done. You can filter by a range of dates.
If you live in Portugal, you can upload your IRS XML file, and it will add the capital gains rows to your tax form.


Limitations:
1. Assumes that the transactions are done in EUR or USD (or in another currency where the currency pair has EUR as the base currency, like EUR/NOK)
2. Assumes that the CSV has the headers in Portuguese (header in the "samples" directory)

YOUR TAXES ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! ALWAYS QUINTUPLE CHECK THE RESULTS!
